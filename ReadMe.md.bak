# Properties Extra

## Abstract

This is a Windows file explorer extension to modify properties like file extension and creation date.

##Alternatives

I found this...

"Attribute Changer" @ https://www.petges.lu/

..which is a very similar tool (maybe with even more features, but not open source).
